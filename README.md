## The Device

How trivial code may be insidious.

Same ideas is provided in:

* Java
* PHP
* Python
* TypeScript

A nice online playground to copy, paste, and run is https://www.sololearn.com/en/compiler-playground  

## What

The eHome Controllerâ€™s GUI is designed to display the current switching state
of every device currently attached to it, specifically if the device is turned on or off.

## How
The team programs a class called Device, in which every class object represents a
specific device (for example, a particular lamp). The class has the variable $status,
which describes the current status of the device in question.

The methods setStatus() and getStatus() are used to change and read the current status.

Also, the team wrote a unit test to verify the Device class is working as expected.

## Challenge

* here is something wrong with the test?
* here is something wrong with the class?
